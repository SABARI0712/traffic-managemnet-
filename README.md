This project presents a smart traffic management system implemented using the PIC16 microcontroller, designed to efficiently control traffic flow at a four-way intersection by combining fixed signal timing with real-time sensor-based priority handling. The system manages four traffic lanes, namely North-South, East-West, North-East, and South-West, where each direction is equipped with Red, Yellow, and Green signal LEDs to replicate real-world traffic light behavior. The microcontroller is configured to operate at a clock frequency of 1 MHz, ensuring stable timing control while maintaining low power consumption. All sensor inputs are connected through PORTB, while traffic light outputs are distributed across PORTC and PORTD, allowing organized and efficient port utilization.

Under normal operating conditions, the controller follows a predefined traffic sequence in which each lane is given a Green signal for five seconds, allowing vehicles to pass through the intersection safely. After the Green phase, a Yellow signal is activated to indicate transition and caution, followed by the Red state as the next lane becomes active. This cyclic operation ensures fair time distribution among all four directions and prevents signal conflicts. The system continuously repeats this pattern to maintain smooth and organized traffic movement without manual intervention.

To enhance adaptability, the project integrates IR sensors for vehicle detection, enabling real-time traffic density awareness. When a vehicle is detected on any lane, the microcontroller immediately interrupts the ongoing delay cycle and assigns Green priority to the corresponding direction. During this priority operation, all other lanes are forced into the Red state to avoid collisions and ensure safe vehicle passage. After the priority duration completes, the system automatically resumes its normal traffic sequence, ensuring uninterrupted and intelligent operation.

In addition to IR-based control, the system also includes RFID-based priority input functionality, which is designed to provide immediate access to authorized or emergency vehicles such as ambulances or special service units. When an RFID signal is detected, the respective lane is instantly switched to Green for a longer duration compared to normal traffic flow, allowing sufficient time for emergency clearance. This feature demonstrates how embedded systems can be integrated into smart city infrastructure to improve response time and traffic efficiency.

A key feature of this project is the implementation of a custom smart delay mechanism, which continuously monitors both IR and RFID inputs during timing intervals. Unlike conventional delay functions that block processor activity, this approach allows the microcontroller to respond instantly to priority requests without waiting for the completion of fixed delay cycles. This improves the real-time responsiveness and reliability of the system.

Overall, this smart traffic control system demonstrates an effective combination of embedded hardware interfacing, real-time signal processing, and intelligent traffic management logic. The project highlights the practical application of microcontrollers in automation and smart transportation systems, making it suitable for academic demonstrations, prototype development, and future expansion into advanced traffic monitoring solutions.
